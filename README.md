## Hi, I'm Rohan</br>
I'm a CS undergrad diving deep into the world of programming and problem-solving! 
### Currently focusing on:

- C++ for understanding object-oriented concepts and competitive programming</br>
- C for low-level programming and systems knowledge</br>
- Python for scripting, data science, and automation</br>

### 🌱 What I’m learning and exploring:
- Building a solid foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms
- Experimenting with simple projects and mini-games to reinforce my learning
- Understanding how computers work at a lower level using C
  #### I am also exploring
- Quantum Computing: Understanding the basics of qubits, superposition, and entanglement
- Cybersecurity: cryptography, and ethical hacking


### 🚀 My Goals:
1. Contribute to open-source projects and learn best practices</br>
1. Build a personal project portfolio with meaningful, fun projects</br>
1. Master the basics of software development and code readability</br>
1. Gain hands-on experience with Cybersecurity Challenges and Quantum Algorithms</br>
